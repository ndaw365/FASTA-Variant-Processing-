#  Generating FASTA datasets for Variant Processing

This repository focuses on converting datasets from public resources into proteomic, search-compatible FASTA format. This is a building step to generate custom variant-containing FASTA databases. 

## Input:
**WT_og.csv file:** 

## Code:


## Output:
**output_name_file**: .fasta file that holds the WT forward & reversed sequences, and forward & reversed sequences for mutations.

Structure of headers are identified as such:
> sp_VariantTag_Fwd/Rev | Uniprot ID | Organism (OS)  Gene Name (GN)
